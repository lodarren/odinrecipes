    <h2>For this you need the following ingredients for the base batter:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>All-purpose flour (plain flour)</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Baking powder</li>
        <li>Baking powder</li>
        <li>Dashi (Japanese soup stock)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> and now for the Okonomiyaki: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Tenkasu (tempura scraps)</li>
        <li>Pickled red ginger (kizami shoga)</li>
        <li>Green cabbage</li>
        <li>Sliced pork belly </li>
    </ul>   
    
    <h2>Steps to follow: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li> <b>Make the base batter.</b> It’s said that making the base batter ahead of time improves the flavor and fluffiness of the okonomiyaki. It’s up to you. You can at least rest the batter a little while you prep other ingredients.</li>
        <li><b>Prep the ingredients.</b> Cut all the ingredients. Make sure to drain the cabbage well so the moisture won’t dilute the batter.</li>
        <li><b>Make the okonomiyaki batter.</b> Add eggs, tempura scraps, chopped red pickled ginger, then finely chopped cabbage. Mix them all together.</li>
        <li><b>Cook the okonomiyaki batter in frying pans or an electric griddle.</b> </li>
        <li><b>Add condiments and toppings.</b> Enjoy! </li>
    </ol>    

    I'm hungry now.
